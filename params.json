{"tagline":"Some Scala Learning","body":"### What is Scala?\r\nThese notes assume that the basic of programming are known are hence fast paced, it has the code linked to the same repository all the codes from basics are written in full.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### simple build tool\r\n\r\nIts a build written in scala provides major conveniences of Scala. It provides a full language support for creating tasks. Launches REPL in project context and had a continuous command execution. Other advantages are\r\n* Generated docs by scaladoc\r\n* Supports mixed Scala/Java projects\r\n* Supports Testing with ScalaCheck, specs, and ScalaTest (JUnit is supported by a plugin)\r\n* Sub-project support (put multiple packages in one project)\r\n* External project support (list a git repository as a dependency!)\r\n* Parallel task execution, including parallel test execution\r\n* \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIt is now bundled with a lot of operating systems some of their commands are\r\n``\r\nyum install sbt\r\n\r\napt-get install sbt\r\n* in few cases this might be needed to be added http://apt.typesafe.com/repo-deb-build-0002.deb\r\n\r\nsudo port install sbt\r\n\r\nbrew install sbt\r\n``\r\nFor windows the MSI is given at \r\n``\r\nhttp://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.12.0/sbt.msi\r\n``\r\nOR Manually:\r\nDownload the sbt jar from \r\n``\r\nhttp://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/0.12.0/sbt-launch.jar\r\n``\r\nand put it in the ~/bin directory of the project, write a script to run the jar \r\n``\r\njava -Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=384M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar \"$@\"\r\n``\r\nMake the script Executable\r\n```\r\nchmod u+x ~/bin/sbt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2012, Vidyasagar N (@vidyasagar1729)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? contact me at vidyasagar1729@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.","note":"Don't delete this file!
